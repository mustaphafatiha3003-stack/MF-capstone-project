# PATIENT CHURN ANALYSIS IN HEALTHCARE

# Project Overview
Patient churn presents a significant challenge for healthcare providers, affecting revenue stability, continuity of care, and patient outcomes. This project analyzes a dataset of 2,000 patient records to identify key drivers of patient attrition, profile high-risk patient segments, and quantify the financial impact of churn. Using Python for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and streamlit for reporting, this project delivers data-driveninsights and actionable recommendations to support patient retention strategies.

# Business Problem
Healthcare organizations lose substantial revenue and patient lifetime value due to patient attrition. Understanding who is churning, why they churn, and which patients are at highest risk is critical for designing proactive retention interventions and improving patient experience.

# Project Objectives
-   Analyze patient churn patterns and quantify churn rates.
-   Identify key drivers of patient attrition.
-   Profile high-risk patient segments.
-   Estimate revenue at risk.
-   Provide actionable retention recommendations.

# Dataset Description
-   Source: Kaggle (Patient Churn Prediction Dataset for Healthcare)
-   Records: 2,000 patients
-   Target Variable: Churned (0 = Retained, 1 = Churned)

# Feature Categories
- Demographics
- Service Utilization
- Satisfaction Metrics
- Engagement Indicators
- Financial Factors

# Tools Used
-   Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-   Google colab
-   Streamlit
-   Google docs
-   GitHub

# Key Findings
-   Overall churn rate: 68.35%
-   Low satisfaction strongly associated with churn
-   Long inactivity increases attrition risk
-   Billing issues and high out-of-pocket costs drive churn
-   Estimated revenue at risk: $1,174,452

# Conclusion
Patient churn is primarily driven by experience, engagement, and financial friction rather than demographics alone. Churn is predictable and preventable using data-driven early warning indicators.

# Recommendations
1.  Proactive outreach to inactive patients.
2.  Improve wait times and overall interactions.
3.  Promote patient portal adoption.
4.  Resolve billing issues quickly.
5.  Focus on high-risk patient segments.
